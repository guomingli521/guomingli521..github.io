The main task is to use the drone to identify ground-specific light bar markers and focus on the score by placing a golf ball. It is divided into four parts in the video. The first part is to identify the target with computer vision, and to make the robot approach the target point through a motion algorithm, stabilize the hover, and put the golf ball. Both the second part and the third part add prediction algorithms based on the original. That is, predicting the relative position of the aerial robot and the ground robot within a limited field of view, thereby releasing the golf ball in advance and hitting the target The fourth part is the demand for the rules of the game. By identifying the apron with color features and landing stably 室内移动机器人平台是我在大学中设计并制作的一个功能验证性平台，设计的主要目的是为了利于之后的导航功能移植和添加。同时也是我的毕业设计课题。在这个项目中我主要进行了导航定位等相关算法的学习，独自实现的下位机的运动控制与数据通讯，优化了里程计数据的稳定新与准确性。熟悉了cartographer等主流slam算法。了解掌握了ros导航框架，并对astar djikstar等全局规划算法进行了初步学习与了解。在此利用一个机器人进门的实际效果作为演示。 The indoor mobile robot platform is a functional verification platform that I designed and produced in the university. The main purpose of the design is to facilitate the subsequent migration and addition of navigation functions. It is also my graduation project. In this project, I mainly studied the navigation related algorithms, and realized the motion control and data communication of the lower computer independently, which optimized the stability and accuracy of the odometer data. Familiar with mainstream slam algorithms such as cartographer. Understand the mastery of the ros navigation framework, and learn and understand the global planning algorithms such as astar djikstar. Here, the actual effect of a robot entering the door is used as a demonstration.","link":"/2019/10/16/person-achievement/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
